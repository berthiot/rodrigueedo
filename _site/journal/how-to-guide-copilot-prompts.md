# How to Guide GitHub Copilot for Portfolio Journal Entries

## Purpose
This guide helps you give clear prompts to Copilot so you get a detailed, private journal entry at the end of each work session.

---

## 1. At the Start of a Session
- Tell Copilot you want a journal entry at the end.
- Example prompt: "Please keep track of everything we do today and write a journal entry for me at the end."

## 2. During the Session
- Be specific about what you want to learn or change (e.g., CSS, layout, colors, responsiveness).
- Ask Copilot to explain concepts as you go.
- Example prompt: "Can you explain how this CSS works?" or "Show me how to change the color scheme."

## 3. At the End of the Session
- Remind Copilot to create a journal entry.
- Example prompt: "Please write my journal entry for today and save it in the journal folder."
- Ask for a summary of key points, what was changed, and how to edit in the future.

## 4. For Ongoing Journals
- Ask Copilot to use a clear file naming system (e.g., `portfolio-journal-YYYY-MM-DD.md`).
- Example prompt: "Add today's entry to the journal folder with the date in the filename."

## 5. For Deeper Learning
- Ask Copilot to break down complex topics into simple explanations.
- Example prompt: "Explain how gradients work in CSS and how I can change them."

## 6. For Customization
- Ask Copilot to show you exactly where to edit code or settings.
- Example prompt: "Show me where to change the profile image size in the CSS."

## Example End-of-Session Prompt

## Tips
- Be as specific as possible with your requests.
- Ask for explanations, code samples, and editing instructions.
- Use the journal as your personal learning log and reference.
